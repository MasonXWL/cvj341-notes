    <h1>Extra Credit</h1>

    <p>Oh, by the way...</p>

    <p>I make mistakes from time to time. Professors = 100 percent human.</p>

    <p>The faster you learn git and GitHub, the sooner you may earn points.</p>

    <p>Found a mistake &mdash; a coding error, a typo, something broken &mdash; in the class notes or code examples? Correct it and submit a pull request on GitHub. Each accepted pull request is worth one point toward your final grade. (In the case of multiple submissions, the first with the correct fix will earn the point.)</p>

    <p>The catch? There are about 50 students taking CVJ 341 this semester, and you share the same notes repo. If you find an error, move fast!</p>

    <p>Good luck!</p>
